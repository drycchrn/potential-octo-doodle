<!-- TODO: Make it so that you have a button to “start the game” — 
  it should only start the game when this is clicked, and you should be able to click this to restart a new game.-->
<!-- TODO: Add a small form to the HTML that lets you enter the colors for the players, 
  so that when you start a new game, it uses these player colors.-->
